Everyone has hobbies. My hobby is in a big red bookcase. Currently my big red bookcase contains around ~200 dead-tree books on statistics, data science, research, and mathematics. I rarely travel anywhere without at least one book from this bookcase and on a lazy Sunday afternoon you will likely see to working my way through one of it's members.
