## While loops until a condition is true.

### Import the random module.


```python
import random
```

### Create a variable of the true number of deaths of an event.


```python
deaths = 6
```

### Create a variable that is denotes if the while loop for keep running.


```python
running = True
```

### while running is True


```python
while running:
    # Create a variable that randomly create a integer between 0 and 10.
    guess = random.randint(0,10)

    # if guess equals deaths,
    if guess == deaths:
        # then print this
        print('Correct!')
        # and then also change running to False to stop the script
        running = False
    # else if guess is lower than deaths
    elif guess < deaths:
        # then print this
        print('No, it is higher.')
    # if guess is none of the above
    else:
        # print this
        print('No, it is lower')
```

    No, it is lower
    No, it is higher.
    Correct!


By the output, you can see that the while script keeping generating guesses and checking them until guess matches deaths, in which case the script stops.
