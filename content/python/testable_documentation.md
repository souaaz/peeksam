Interesting in learning more? Here are some good books on unit testing in Python: [Python Testing: Beginner's Guide](http://amzn.to/2j6dHLc) and [Python Testing Cookbook](http://amzn.to/2j6hubL).

## Preliminaries


```python
import doctest
```

## Create A Function To Test

Note that our test cases are inside the function's documentation. Each test case is marked by a `>>>` and the expect output is the line below.


```python
def summation(a, b):
    """
    Takes two inputs and outputs their sum.

    Tests:

    >>> summation(5, 4)
    9

    >>> summation(4, 3)
    7

    >>> summation('foo','bar')
    'foobar'

    >>> summation(3,'d')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
    """
    return a + b
```

Notice that in the last test, we are making sure the function outputs the correct error.

## Test Function


```python
doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
```

    Trying:
        summation(5, 4)
    Expecting:
        9
    ok
    Trying:
        summation(4, 3)
    Expecting:
        7
    ok
    Trying:
        summation('foo','bar')
    Expecting:
        'foobar'
    ok
    Trying:
        summation(3,'d')
    Expecting:
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
    ok
    1 items had no tests:
        __main__
    1 items passed all tests:
       4 tests in __main__.summation
    4 tests in 2 items.
    4 passed and 0 failed.
    Test passed.
