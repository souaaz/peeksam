## Preliminaries


```python
import markovify
```

## Load Corpus

The corpus I am using is just one I found online. The corpus you choose is central to generating realistic text.


```python
# Get raw text as string
with open("brown.txt") as f:
    text = f.read()
```

## Build Markov Chain


```python
# Build the model.
text_model = markovify.Text(text)
```

# Generate One Tweet


```python
# Print three randomly-generated sentences of no more than 140 characters
for i in range(3):
    print(text_model.make_short_sentence(140))
```
