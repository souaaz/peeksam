Nearest neighbor imputations which weights samples using the mean squared difference on features for which two rows both have observed data. In this example, we use 3 nearest rows which have a feature to fill in each row's missing features.

## Preliminaries


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from fancyimpute import KNN
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline  
```

    Using Theano backend.


## Create Data


```python
df = pd.DataFrame()

df['x0'] = [0.3051,0.4949,0.6974,0.3769,0.2231,0.341,0.4436,0.5897,0.6308,0.5]
df['x1'] = [np.nan,0.2654,0.2615,0.5846,0.4615,0.8308,0.4962,0.3269,0.5346,0.6731]


df.head()
```




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>x0</th>
      <th>x1</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>0.3051</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>0.4949</td>
      <td>0.2654</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>0.6974</td>
      <td>0.2615</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>0.3769</td>
      <td>0.5846</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>0.2231</td>
      <td>0.4615</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



## View The Raw Data


```python
# Create data, with the first observation containing a missing value
X = df.as_matrix(columns=['x0', 'x1'])

# View data

```




    array([[ 0.3051,     nan],
           [ 0.4949,  0.2654],
           [ 0.6974,  0.2615],

           [ 0.341 ,  0.8308],
           [ 0.4436,  0.4962],
           [ 0.5897,  0.3269],
           [ 0.6308,  0.5346],
           [ 0.5   ,  0.6731]])




```python
# Plot data
plt.scatter(X[:,0],X[:,1])
```

## Impute Using K-Nearest Neighbors


```python
# Imput missing values from three closest observations
X_imputed = KNN(k=3).complete(X)

# View new data
X_imputed
```

    Computing pairwise distances between 10 samples
    Computing distances for sample #1/10, elapsed time: 0.000
    Imputing row 1/10 with 1 missing columns, elapsed time: 0.002





    array([[ 0.3051    ,  0.73900744],
           [ 0.4949    ,  0.2654    ],
           [ 0.6974    ,  0.2615    ],
           [ 0.3769    ,  0.5846    ],
           [ 0.2231    ,  0.4615    ],
           [ 0.341     ,  0.8308    ],
           [ 0.4436    ,  0.4962    ],
           [ 0.5897    ,  0.3269    ],
           [ 0.6308    ,  0.5346    ],
           [ 0.5       ,  0.6731    ]])



Notice that the first observation previously contained a missing value. However, now it contains a new value: `0.73900744`

## View Imported Value


```python
n=['  Imputed X1','','','','','','','','','']

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(X_imputed[:,0], X_imputed[:,1])

for i, txt in enumerate(n):
    ax.annotate(txt, (X_imputed[:,0][i],X_imputed[:,1][i]))
```
